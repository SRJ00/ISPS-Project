# ISPS Project

Multiple researchers posited the impact of Covid-19 on hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. This project compares the spread of diseases before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Data from NFHS 4 and NFHS 5 from the states affected by COVID were considered to compare the prevalence of different diseases before and during the pandemic.

The analysis is done using the standard statistical procedure as well as the Bayesian method.

After comparing the time and age-adjusted rates using standard statistical procedures, we observe that there are significant differences in the rates for immunity and severe anaemia in children, severe anaemia in men, severe hypertension in adults, and severe obesity in adults.

We use the Bayesian method to compute the probability of an increase in the spread of diseases during COVID-19.
